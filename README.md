# ismet_samsodien_cv_v2
Online CV Version 2.0

A substantial amount of researching used; books and going as far as using the github articles getting to know every function of constructing a powerful yet elegant one pager website.
I came up with a solution to use a one pager website rather than using multiple pages. In this project my code included sass which implemented each aspect of each scss file. My ojective for doing this was so that I could in-corporate the new age code with javascripting to make the page come alive.


## Setting up my workspace

- Created a new repository on the Github named ismet94/ismet_samsodien_cv_v2
- Save to desired directory
- Created a base folder structure this included the images folder, icons, file, css, js and scss using the make directory command as seen below:
```
mkdir "name of folder being created"
```
also used the touch command to create my files.
```
touch "name of file being created"
```
- Cloned the ismet_samsodien_cv_v2 to the desktop uising gitBash command as seen below:
```
git clone https://github.com/ismet94/ismet_samsodien_cv_v2.git

```
- Pushed all code to the Github and adding a message to keep track of the code im uploading, below are these commands:
```
cd ismet_samsodien_cv_v2
git add .
git commit -m "Message to display on the github website"
git push -u origin master

```
- When working on another workbench the git pull function was used.
```
cd ismet_samsodien_cv_v2
git pull

```
- Updated Readme file on a regular bases.
- Created Live Link as listed below.
